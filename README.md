# Java Phone System

**Java-Phone-System** is a comprehensive Java-based mobile application suite developed as a group project for the "Software Engineering" course in Bar-Ilan University.
This project simulates a full-featured phone system that includes various applications such as Phone Book, SMS, Calendar, Media, Phone Calls, Wallet, and Casino.
The objective was to implement object-oriented principles, design patterns, and an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing.

The project received a grade of **98/100**, reflecting its technical complexity, functionality, and adherence to software engineering best practices.

## Features

- **PhoneBook**: Manage contacts (add, edit, delete, search).
- **SMS**: Send, receive, and view text messages.
- **Calendar**: Manage events, schedule meetings, and set reminders.
- **Media Player**: Play songs and videos in multiple formats.
- **Phone Calls**: Simulate making and receiving calls.
- **Casino**: Enjoy games like BlackJack and Slots.
- **Wallet**: Manage virtual currency for use in the Casino.
- **User Interface**: Java Swing-based GUI for an intuitive user experience.

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK).
- An IDE like Eclipse or VS Code.

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Build the project and run the `TestMobilePhone.java` file to start the application.

## Application Descriptions

### PhoneBook
Manage contacts (name, phone-number) with these features:
*  Add Contact.
*  Delete Contact.
*  Print All Contacts.
*  Search Contact.
*  Sort Contacts (by name/phone-number).
*  Remove Duplicates (same name).
*  Reverse Order (by name).
*  Save to file \ Load from file (.txt file).

### SMS
Send and receive text messages. The SMS inbox displays all received messages, and users can send new ones to contacts in the PhoneBook.

### Calendar
Create, edit, and delete events. Set reminders and schedule meetings. The calendar provides an overview of all scheduled events.

### Media Player
Media is defined as Song or Video, with name and time.
Simulates youtube. Can accept new media (Add Media) and play it: Play Media by Name / Play all Media.

### Phone Calls
Simulate making and receiving phone calls. Users can dial a number or call a contact from the PhoneBook. Call logs are also maintained.

### Casino
Play two games—BlackJack and Slots—using virtual currency from the Wallet. The games simulate real-life casino odds with randomly generated outcomes.

### Wallet
Manage virtual currency used for betting in the Casino. The Wallet keeps track of the user’s balance, and users can add or withdraw virtual money.

## Technical Details

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **GUI Framework**: Java Swing
- **Data Management**: In-memory data structures (can be extended to use databases).
